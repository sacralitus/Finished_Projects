Some of the educational projects I managed to finish some time ago. Overall, they don't represent any significant value but here rather for nostalgia purpose :)
* **Flask_app** - application with TF-IDF Info Search implemented.
* **NLP Basics** - my author course for introductory immersion in Natural Language Processing.
* **Sentiment Analysis (Hackathon)** - some code with classic ML approaches to the sentiment analysis problem claimed in the NLP hackaton.
* **Zvezda_Disambiguation/FlaskApplication** - some handmade word context-based approach to solve Word Sense Disambiguation problem (educational sense only).
* **dysphonia_classifier** - my diploma in Minsk State Linguistic University. Contains some research, EDA, data processing approach, ML models for binary classification of patient's voices by voice pathology (dysphonia) presence.
